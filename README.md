# Sensor-Data-on-Webpage-using-ESP8266
    In this project we are implementing a system such that the values of sensors are displayed on a web page.
    
 For this purpose,
    we connect the sensor to esp8266 module and the data is published on the ip of esp device
    
    the published values can be viewed by opening the browser and entering the ip of the device(esp) in url bar.
    
   NOTE:
      The browser in which we need to observe the output should be connected to same network as the device.
      
  This project initially works over a local area network 
  
  since the device ip doesn't work over internet, If it need to work over the internet a domain name is to be assigned for the ip of esp device.
